# Machine_Learning_Based_Approach_for_Fake_News_Detection
This project focuses on fake news detection using machine learning algorithms including Passive Aggressive Classifier, SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The Passive Aggressive Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy among the models tested. A user-friendly GUI is implemented for easy interaction and  fake news classification.
